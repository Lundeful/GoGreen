# Go Green - Web project fall 2018
This website was created as our final project in the course *Web project* at Oslo Metropolitan University (OsloMet). The Assignment was to find a social or technological problem and create a website that showed off a solution to that problem. No libraries or similar tools (react, bootstrap etc) were allowed.
