# Why did we create this app? 
Climate change is real. The world is getting warmer, extreme weather events are more intense and frequent, sea levels are rising fast and animals are going extinct. If we are to stop these climate changes and avoid the worst consequences we all need to take action. Aside from making government and corporate entities apply policies to become more eco-friendly the most important step we can take is to make changes in our daily lives and become more environmentally friendly in the way we travel and consume. This sends signals to other people, governments and companies and has a great impact on the world. </br> </br>

But changing our habits isn't always easy. So we sought out to create an app that helps you do just that and together we can help make the world greener.

# How does the app work?

The app works by tracking your habits that have an effect on the environment and then help you change it from a negative to a positive impact. </br></br>

You start by adding your routines for travel and consuption to work as a starting point, and then the app will make suggestions on how you can cut down on your emissions. You can log different activities, like taking bus instead of car, and that will count towards your statistics on how much you reduce your carbon footprint. You can check your progress through easy to read graphics and see how great your effort really is. When you reach milestones the app will show you what you've achieved and how it impacts the world.
